super:
  description: |
    Version one of a small superposition prover
    written in Lean. This repository introduces
    a tactic `super` which attempts to solve
    problems in first order logic, possibly
    given a list of extra hypotheses.

    This version is not compatible with community
    releases of Lean.

mathematica:
  description: |
    Connects Lean to the computer algebra system
    Mathematica. This project offers a
    bi-directional translation between the two
    systems. From within Lean, you can evaluate
    Mathematica commands, possibly including
    translated Lean expressions, and process
    the results. From Mathematica, you can access
    a Lean environment.

    Examples of calling Mathematica from Lean
    can be found at
    [robertylewis/mathematica_examples](https://github.com/robertylewis/mathematica_examples),
    and examples in the other direction at
    [minchaowu/mm-lean](https://github.com/minchaowu/mm-lean).
    These repositories are not in the contrib list
    because they depend on Mathematica, which
    is proprietary software.

topos:
  description: |
    This repository contains formal verifications of results in Topos Theory, drawing from "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic" and "Sketches of an Elephant". It currently includes a range of constructions and theorems about both Grothendieck topoi and elementary toposes.

lean-perfectoid-spaces:
  description: |
    Perfectoid spaces are sophisticated objects in arithmetic geometry
    introduced by Peter Scholze in 2012. We formalised enough definitions
    and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to define perfectoid
    spaces in Lean. See also our
    [project webpage](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/)
    and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12320).

sudoku:
  description: |
    This is an implementation of sudoku, written in Lean. When you open a
    level in VS Code, a sudoku board is displayed in the goal view. You can
    put numbers (and also pencil marks) on the board by adding hypotheses,
    but you have to prove that the placement of the number follows logically
    from what is already on the board! There are some tactics to help you with
    this, and you can also prove theorems to build up your personal library of
    sudoku theory.

lftcm2020:
  description: |
    This repository contains tutorials about Lean and mathlib that were developed
    for the workshop [Lean for the Curious Mathematician](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lftcm2020/),
    held in July 2020. The tutorials range from introductory lessons on numbers,
    logic, and sets to advanced lessons on category theory and manifolds.
    In addition to the materials found in this repository, we recommend watching
    the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNlxexiNJErGJd2dte_J1t1N)
    of the tutorials and lectures from the workshop.

rubiks-cube-group:
  description: |
    This project formalizes the Rubik's cube group as a product of corner orientation,
    corner permutation, edge orientation, and edge permutation.

    The solvable subgroup is defined as the the set of positions where both orientations sum
    to 0 and the permutations have the same sign.

    This project includes a widget to visualize elements of the group as physical puzzle states.

lean-gptf:

    Provides an interactive frontend to Lean GPT-f,
    a neural theorem prover which relies on a large Transformer language model to suggest tactics.
    It can prove nearly 50% of the remaining theorems in a held-out test set.

lean-social-choice:
  description: |
    Social Choice Theory is a theoretical framework
    at the intersection of philosophy, political science, and
    welfare economics. It studies methods for aggregating
    individual preferences into collective social welfare functions.

    This is a library of noteworthy proofs from Social Choice Theory
    formalized in Lean.

flt-regular:
  description: |
    The goal of this project is to formalize Kummer's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular
    prime exponents. This was a landmark 19th century result in algebraic number theory, proving the theorem
    in many new cases at the time, but is quite different to the final proof of the full theorem, due to
    Wiles-Taylor. This project hopes to add more material on algebraic number theory and related
    topics to mathlib in addition to formalizing a version of Kummer's proof.

unit-fractions:
  description: |
    This project formalizes the main results of the preprint [On a density conjecture about unit fractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03726) in Lean.
    One of these results says that any dense set of naturals contains distinct naturals whose reciprocals sum to 1.

lean-acl-pairs:
  description: |
    This project contains formalization of the relationship between so-called `acl`-pairs and valuation rings.
    If `K` and `F` are two fields, a pair of (group) morphisms `f g : Kˣ → F` is called an `acl`-pair provided that `f u * g v = f v * g u` whenever `u + v = 1` in `K`.
    The main result regarding such pairs shows that they essentially always arise from valuation theory, at least when `F` is a prime field (such as `ℚ` or `zmod p` where `p` is prime).
    The proofs formalized in this repository are based on ideas of Bogomolov-Tschinkel, Efrat, Koenigsmann, and the author.
    This repository also formalizes some results about rigid elements and valuation which are due to Arason-Elman-Jacob.

sphere-eversion:
  description: |
    In this project we formalize the proof of existence of sphere eversions in Lean. More precisely, we aim to formalize the full h-principle for open and ample first order differential relations, and deduce existence of sphere eversions as a corollary.

flypitch:
  description: |
    The Flypitch project gives a formal proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis from ZFC.
    The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinality between the smallest infinite cardinal and the cardinality of the continuum.
    This project also develops a library of first-order logic, set theory and forcing.
